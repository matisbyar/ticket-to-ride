# Ticket to Ride

## About

Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure in which players collect and play matching train cards to claim railway routes connecting cities throughout North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who can fulfill their Destination Tickets by connecting two distant cities, and to the player who builds the longest continuous railway.

## Development Team

Ticket to Ride PC game was developed by a team of two developers, [Erwan Vivien](https://github.com/Haaarf) and myself. We worked together to bring this classic board game to the digital world. This is one of our projects held during our 2nd Semester at the IUT de Montpellier-SÃ¨te.

## Technologies

The game was built using Java, JavaFX and Graph Theories. Java was used for its robustness and cross-platform compatibility, while JavaFX was used to create the game's graphical user interface. Graph Theories were used for the game's algorithmic logic, such as determining the shortest route between two cities.

## Development Timeline

The development of Ticket to Ride PC game took 3 months, divided into 3 steps, with each step dedicated to a specific technology. The first month was spent on developing the game's backend using Java. The second month was spent on creating the game's graphical user interface using JavaFX. The final month was spent on implementing the game's algorithmic logic using Graph Theories.

We hope you enjoy playing Ticket to Ride on PC as much as we enjoyed creating it!
